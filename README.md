# Module Two Project

## Portfolio Website

This code was written for my porfolio. The intention is to update it as I go through the bootcamp with my work, my contact info, and my experiance. This code should follow current accessability standards, be responsive, and serve as a display of all the work I have done throughout my time in the course and all the work I will do after.

## Home

The homepage features a background photo of my choice, which I can change at any point, and a greeting that I feel suits me most!

## About

This will function as a resume of sorts, but also allows for hiring managers to see what I'm like as a person and the way that I enjoy coding the most.

## My Work

This will display all of my work! As the list grows, I want to change the way it appears, and allow for the "hover" option to display which types of code I used for each project, but as the list is quite short at the moment, there is not much to display.

## Contact

I also hope to grow this list as well the longer that I'm in the industry. For now, I've added a few links.
